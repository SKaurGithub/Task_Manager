# Task Manager
This is a program designed for a small business to help it manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

## What can the Task Manager do?
The Task Manager allows the user and the admin to:
- Register another user.
- Add tasks.
- View all tasks.
- View the current user's tasks.

The admin has some additional options such as:
- Generate reports (Task overview report and User overview report).
- Display statistics.

## Why is the Task Manager important?
- Provides users an overview, where they stand with their tasks and when the tasks should be completed by.
- Allows users/admin to register new users easily.
- Helps admin to keep track of total tasks, tasks which are complete, incomplete and overdue.
- Allows admin to generate up-to-date reports as text files, which can be used to present at possible meetings.
  These reports are an overview of the users registered to the Task Manager and their tasks.
- Provides admin to also display statistics to the screen, which is displayed in a user friendly manner.
